<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am a qualified Actuary (FASSA) with more than six years’ experience in the
  life and general insurance fields. My passion for solving complex problems,
  and ability to up-skill myself and synergise in a team, has allowed me to
  excel in PwC’s actuarial department. I was promoted to a manager after three
  and a half years at the company. I’ve specialised in IFRS 17 reporting, by
  building large sections of the technical blueprint for PwC South Africa's IFRS
  17 solution and taking part in, and managing multiple IFRS 17 implementation
  projects and model validation exercises. In addition to my IFRS 17 work, I
  have experience in valuing IFRS 2 share schemes and IAS 19 employee benefits
  schemes, assisting with IFRS 4 and SAM valuations, and performing due
  diligence on life and general insurers.
